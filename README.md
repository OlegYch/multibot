An instance of this fork of multibot hangs out in https://gitter.im/scala/scala
and in the #scala channel on FreeNode IRC.  It's managed by @OlegYch.

There's also a dedicated Gitter room, https://gitter.im/OlegYch/multibot,
where you can test and interact with the bot without bothering all of
the people in the main Scala room.
